I started working as a graphic designer in 2000 and have worked in advertising, entertainment, direct mail marketing and public relations. I added my love of photography to my work a few years ago when I created Sunshine Photos and it's been a great addition to my career.

Although I love print design and photography, I realized a while ago that there's so much more I could do if I learned to code. I entered Bloc Academy's Full Stack Web Developer program in 2016 and began my journey into web development. The program started with Ruby and Ruby on Rails then went in to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Angular.
