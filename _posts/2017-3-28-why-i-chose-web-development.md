title: Why I Chose Web Development
---
I love retouching, graphic design and photography but there's only so much I can do with it. Nowadays, everybody wants apps and websites and I can't say I blame them. I really wanted to know not only how to design apps and websites but how to build them. As a creative person who's not always so great at technical stuff, I worried about my ability to handle the logic required to become a good coder. I found article after article online about how easy it is to code and was skeptical. Like any other challenge, though, I realized I had to try it to find out for myself.

I spent weeks reading about various online coding bootcamps and decided to go with Bloc Academy. They connect you with a mentor who meets with you weekly to help you through the program and you can change the speed of your program at any time. As a busy freelancer and parent, I needed that flexibility. They also let you access the course curriculum after you complete your program. My program did both back-end and front-end web development but I knew my career focus would be on front-end. I thought it would be helpful to me in the long run to be able to go back and re-take the back-end curriculum later if I needed to for any future projects. Despite my fears, I decided jumping in and trying it would be the best course of action so I did.
