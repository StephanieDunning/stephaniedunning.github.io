As I predicted, web development was interesting but also hard. When I retouch photos I can fly by the seat of my pants. I don't have any set formula. I just do what looks good. Unfortunately, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and the other programs I was learning at Bloc didn't work that way. Precision is a must. It was easy to get overwhelmed and I'll admit I thought about giving up at first.

Just like I found tons of articles online about how easy it is to code, I found just as many articles online about how hard it can be and how many people give up too soon. Like any new skill, it takes practice. The amount of information out there is huge, which I think is one of the reasons why so many people give up. Photoshop seemed overwhelming to me at first, too, but I stuck with it and now I love it.

I've always loved puzzles (crossword puzzles are my favorite) so I decided to view coding like puzzles. If something wasn't working it meant a puzzle piece was missing and I made it my mission to find it. That change in attitude helped me look at the problems I was having as challenges and helped me stick with my program at Bloc.
