Bloc has been a great learning experience and I know MUCH more about web development than I thought I could a few months ago. I still need more practice and would like to now focus more on UI/UX Design. I think that will help me combine what I learned in the Full Stack Web Developer Program with the years of experience I have as a print graphic designer.

I'm going to start studying UI/UX Design next but I'll continue to practice what I learned in the Full Stack Program. There are so many free tutorials online that I never tried that would really supplement what I learned at Bloc and refresh my memory on the information I learned months ago at the beginning of my program. I also plan on re-taking some of the program in my spare time. The fact that the curriculum is still available to me since I finished the program was one of the reasons I chose this school and I look forward to making use of it while I go further into UI/UX.
